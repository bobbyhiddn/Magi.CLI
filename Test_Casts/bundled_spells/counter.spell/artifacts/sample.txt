In the mystical realm of code,
Where spells and functions intertwine,
Magic flows through every node,
As algorithms dance in line.

Binary whispers in the night,
Casting shadows on the screen,
Data streams with pure delight,
In patterns rarely seen.

Debugging rituals we perform,
With sacred tools and ancient lore,
Through chaos and through storm,
Until our spells work once more.

In this digital sanctum pure,
Where wizards write their sacred scripts,
Each bug we aim to cure,
With magical git commits.
