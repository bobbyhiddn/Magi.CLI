# Test_Casts

- This is a repository for testing the functionality of the cast command. It has all castable file types. 

- If you want to cast test.spell from the .tome directory within this repository, you must cd into the Test_Casts directory and then cast test.spell. This is because the .tome directory is relative to the current working directory. 
  - I'll probably change this in the future.
